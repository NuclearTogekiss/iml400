                <center><h2>Aesthetics of the Internet</h2>
                <p>
                    I agree with most of what the article said.  It starts out by defining the internet culture that we live in.  What thrives in that system and more importantly what doesn’t.  The point about how technology builds upon past iterations of itself really resonates with me because “invention” in today’s society really is dead.  Everything is innovation; make this smaller, make this a better resolution, make this more energy efficient.  Everything is just improved, nothing is really new.  The internet however allows us to create more easily.  New ideas appear on the internet every second, not all of them good, but it is the greatest think tank in the history of mankind.  On that train of thought, the point about how the internet is a system of order and chaos is not quite right.  While i agree it is both, it is not both at the same time.  There are very few spaces on the internet where chaos and order are meshed together like image boards and chatrooms.  Most areas of the internet will either embody chaos or order but not both.  Sites like Reddit and Youtube will self organize themselves using their built in rating systems while sites like 4chan are just a random amalgamation of nonsense.

                <center><h2>Tim Berners Lee</h2></center>
                <p>
The article covers why the world wide web is better than other web networks like Gopher or WAIS.  The basic tenant of his argument was the connectivity that the WWW provided between pages and how easy it was to send information via computer addresses.  In turn those same addresses could be very easily searched up in order to access more information.  In addition, the ability to transfer rich media such as pictures and files makes HTTP a very easy way to disseminate rich information.  The WWW made the web interesting and made news, media, and data easily accessible to all.

                <p>
                    The two articles I liked most were the “Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design” and the “Why Angry Birds is so successful and popular”.  The Eight Golden Rules I liked because it was just a well laid out almost step by step guide for interface design while still not telling you exactly what to do.  What I mean by that is that it’s a guide that tells you how to do something, not what you should do.  It doesn’t lead by telling you to do something it tells you how to do it.  Like step four: Design dialog to yield closure.  Eight out of ten guides would give you an example and explain the example and that is often very frustrating because that example won’t cover every scenario.  Here they tell you what to look out for when creating the dialog closure such as organizing it into groups and to make sure the sections visually flow into each other.  What I liked about the Angry Birds article was how it touched upon the little things in Angry Birds that make it the game it is and how those things compound into the massive success that it is.  Like the effort into making the game as simple and rewarding as possible or how they put just a slight delay on the reward feedback to capture the player’s attention for just those few more moments.  As a game design student the little details in interactive designs are the most fascinating to me because they are most often the ones that people overlook but are the ones that are most crucial.

                <center><h2>internet as Art</h2></center>
                <p>
                    Almost as soon as broadband became popular and people started being able to download and view images on the internet easily and quickly, art began popping up on the internet and sites devoted to artists came with it.  However these works of art are created in the physical world and then posted online.  This article opened me to the thought of the internet as the platform.  Not just digital art but internet art.  Using the internet so make something beautiful, not necessarily visually beautiful, but creating something with the internet to connect and bring people together and calling it art.  At the end of the day all art is is something that people come together to all appreciate and whether it’s a collection of pigments or a website devoted to helping handicapped people share their routes through the city, it build community and friendships.
