                    I have always disliked most menu systems used on the internet.  They are almost always drop down menus and are effectively boring lists.  While this is a very efficient way to navigate a menu system, its boring and aesthetically unappealing.  I wanted to reimagine this type of menu system so that it would not only aesthetically pleasing, but also more functional.  I took inspiration from the game Spore.  They have a menu system where the player hovers over a circle and other circles appear around the original one creating a sort of growing mass of bubbles.

                    I used a combination of D3.JS and jquery to create the interactions.  D3 is an addon that is generally used to visual data sets and arrays of information.  I used it's 2D object creation as it is similar to the way you create objects in processing and has built in intogrations to Jquery, css, and html.  I used jquery mouse functions to look for the mouse position, specifically when it was over one of the d# objects and when it left the object.  I then had a few lines of D3 which would make pertinant objects appear and disappear with regards to whether the mouse was over or leaving.

                    I was able to create the interation and result I had envisioned and I feel that this system is a tad more efficient.  I feel this way because when you are navigation a normal drop down menu you have to start from the top and go down.  With this model you are equidistant from all options at the start.  Moving forward I would create a more modular system.  As it currently stands I have to place and reposition every circle and piece of text and after working with D3 I know that there are more efficient ways to create this system.
